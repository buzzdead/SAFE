# SAFE
Have to create a files folder and a keys folder (i think) when cloning. Will be fixed later.
To use it, simply start it, generate keys and enter a master password. Then you can store a secret in the dropdownmenu's
"secret.enc" option, or add more secrets (for exmaple a facebook password etc) and store passwords in each of the options in the menu.
To retrieve it simply choose which one you want to retrieve, and click retrieve secret which copies it to clipboard and you can paste it out.
The screenshot function is still in progress as it was a little difficult to adjust it to multiple screens.
Other than that you can encrypt any type of file and decrypt it at a later time.

Screen and file encryption.
- Takes use of a resident key owned by the user of the application, which
  can be used to get the encrypted files at a later time.

- A program for storing passwords in an encrypted format, that can encrypt & decrypt files, take encrypted screenshots
  and with the potential to encrypt your files with another users public key, and then the other user can decrypt it.
  
- To use the program in a secure way, it is advised to backup the keys in the keys folder, as well as
  encrypted files you can't afford to lose. This way your files are secure with encryption, but also
  in the case that you should lose them. All you need to retrieve files are the keys and the encrypted files.
