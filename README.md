# SAFE
Screen and file encryption
- A program to take screenshots that are stored in an encrypted format.
- Takes use of a resident key owned by the user of the application, which
  can be used to get the screenshots at a later time.

- The plan is to make this program viable for easy-to-get secure passwords, or
  just encrypting files in general.
  
- Ultimately enable the program to be able to encrypt files that are decrypted by another user. (PKC)
- Can try it here: <a href="./assets/SAFE.zip" target="_top">Download Page</a>
- 
- Not so much flexibility yet, but to try it out simply generate your private\public key pair by clicking "generate keys". 
- Then you can try to select the secret file from the drop down menu and then click store password to hide your secret.
- Afterwards you can copy the secret back to plaintext into your clipboard by clicking on 'retrieve secret.
- It is also possible to take some screen shots, but its not perfect yet due to multiple displays (work in progress).
- Finally, if you want to decrypt either the secret file or some pictures you took with screen shot you can do so.
- You are restricted to the directories you are prompted to when taking a screenshot or decrypting a file.
