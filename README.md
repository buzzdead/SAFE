# SAFE
Screen and file encryption
- A program to take screenshots that are stored in an encrypted format.
- Takes use of a resident key owned by the user of the application, which
  can be used to get the screenshots at a later time.

- The plan is to make this program viable for easy-to-get secure passwords, or
  just encrypting files in general.
  
- Ultimately enable the program to be able to encrypt files that are decrypted by another user. (PKC)
